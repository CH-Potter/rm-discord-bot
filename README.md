## Getting started notes:
You will need to create a file `tokens_and_other_sensitive_crap.js` in the root directory.
Contents of file: 

```module.exports = { discord_bot_api_key: "Super Secret Token" };```

File is in .gitignore so it should be excluded from your commits.
Don't be silly and put passwords/keys in files that you do commit. If you do, it's to the Gulag with you!

1. Automate the roulette/stats reset
